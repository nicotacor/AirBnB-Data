# AirBnB-Data

## Introduction

We are going to study the variation of prices at different times of the year and what time is better for a traveler to visit Seattle or Boston. For this part, we can use the data provided kaggle, specially calendar.csv data and listings.csv.

## Business Context

In this part weâ€™ll be looking at variation of prices at different times of the year and what time is better for a traveler to visit Seattle or Boston.

1. What is the seasonal pattern of prices in Boston and Seattle?

2. When is more expensive visit this cities?

3. What city es cheaper in holidays: Boston or Seattle?

Also we can examine the listings.csv files and answer the questions:

4. Have cancellation policy got influence in review scores?

5. Are the number of reviews per month indicative of the review scores on a lodging?

## Conclusions

If you want to visit Seattle on a low budget then you should avoid visit the city in July and August as these are the times when average price of listings are fairly high as compared to the other months. Additionally, you should also avoid visit Seattle during weekends as the prices are high compared to that of weekdays.

For Boston, we obtained the same result. However, lodgings in this city are more expensive than in Seattle in holidays. Specially you should avoid Christmas weeks and Columbus Day.

Also, lodgings with a flexible cancellation policy have got an average review score higher than lodgings with a more strict cancellation policy.
